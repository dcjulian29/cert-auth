# To Do

Starting with domain name (contoso.local) the Name of the CA will be contoso.local Root CA
The subordinate will be named contoso.local Signing CA
pki.contoso.local is the "root" of the CA
For each CA (root, signing)

- $Name.cer?? DER format
- $Name.crl   DER format

The root has CRL but not OCSP
the signing has CRL and OCSP and Timestamping(optional)

   Root
   |
   +-- Signing            Client (Email,CodeSigning,Encryption) and Server (manual workflow)
   |
   +-- Acme               Step-CA ACME provisioner
   |
   +-- ActiveDirectory    Windows-specific CA (Optional)

Figure out OCSP...
hosting NGINX? how? ocsp.contoso.local/$Name or ocsp-$Name.contoso.local or $Name.ocsp.contoso.local

Figure out timestamping...
What do I do with cert? what is needed to host? open-source?

Ensure that the CA module can run on Linux in conjunction with the PowershellForOpenSSL module (to shell out to the openssl binary installed)
Possibly the module can be reworked to only use the container so it would be exactly same on Windows and Linux.

API (maybe GO ;) to interact with PowerShell and UI sitting on top of it.

Eventual workflows for API (or lock it to localhost and don't worry about it, or pass it off to a NGINX reverse proxy that uses auth modules)
